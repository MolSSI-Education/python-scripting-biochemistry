    "Matplotlib is a library that supports static, animated and interactive data visualization in Python ([Matplotlib: Visualization with Python](https://matplotlib.org/)). Matplotlib is used alongside numpy to provide for MATLAB-style plotting. You can use matplotlib to create and fully annotate high resolution, publication quality plots that can be easily exported for inclusion in reports and manuscripts. It is possible to create many graph formats in matplotlib, including \"picture within a picture graphs.\" Think of the chart options that are available in your spreadsheet program. These are all available with matplotlib, plus many more. \n",

First, we need to import the library, set the size of the figure and indicate the data for the plot."
