The command for printing the line equation includes `F`, which stands for `formatted string literal`. By using `F` it is possible to pull the values for slope and intercept that were already generated with scipy.stats. It is also possible to set the precision by following the variable name with `:.4f` where 4 is the number of decimal places you want to appear and f represents the datatype, float."

This was omitted because figures for publications and reports normally include separate text with a figure number, title and details as part of the text. To that end, we are going to learn to use the `savefig` command to produce a high resolution figure suitable for publication, which we will then learn to export to a file. Like many commands in python, it is simply a matter of getting the syntax right. We've added one line of code to save a high resolution image of our current figure."
