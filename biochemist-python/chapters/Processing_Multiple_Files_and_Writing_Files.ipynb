    "In our previous lesson, we parsed values from output files.  While you might have seen the utility of doing such a thing, you might have also wondered why we didn't just search the file and cut and paste the values we wanted into a spreadsheet.  If you only have 1 or 2 files, this might be a very reasonable thing to do.  But what if you had 100 files to analyze?  What if you had 1000?  In such a case the cutting and pasting method would be very tedious and time consuming.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the real powers of writing a program to analyze your data is that you can just as easily analyze 100 files as 1 file.  In this example, we are going to parse the PDB files for a series of enzyme structures in the [Protein Data Bank](https://www.rcsb.org/) and extract resolution data and atom counts for each one.  The PDB files are all saved in a folder called PDB_files that you should have downloaded in the setup for this lesson.  Make sure the folder is in the same directory as the directory where you are writing and executing your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze multiple files, we will need to import a python **library**.  A **library** is a set of modules which contain functions. The functions within a library or module are usually related to one another. Using libraries in Python reduces the amount of code you have to write. In the last lesson, we imported `os.path`, which was a module that handled filepaths for us.\n",

To use a function that is in a library, you often use the dot notation introduced earlier.\n",

The datafile.close() command tells the computer you are finished giving it lines to write and that it should go ahead and write the file now.
