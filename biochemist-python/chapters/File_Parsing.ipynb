    "## Working with files\n",
    "One of the most common tasks in research is analyzing data.  An enormous amount of data is currently being generated in biochemistry and molecular biology, much of it pertaining to sequence and structure. The PDB file format is commonly used to describe macromolecular structures that have been determined by experimental methods. You may be interested in exploring the text and/or the data in a PDB file.  While the [PDB web site](https://www.rcsb.org/) is very helpful, there are times when it would be handy to extract specific information about one protein (or 1,000) with a few keystrokes. For example, you might be interested in the resolution of a structure, or the small molecules that are bound to the macromolecule.  In general, this is called file parsing."

    "In Python, there are many ways to read in information from a text file.  The best method to use depends on the type of data and the type of analysis you are performing.  If you have a file with lots of different types of information, text and numbers, with different types of formatting, the most generic way to read in information is the `readlines()` function.  Reading in the file is a two-step process. First, you have to open the file using the file path we defined above. This creates a file object, or filehandle. Then you can read in information with the `readlines()` function. \n",

    "## A final note about regular expressions\n",
    "Sometimes you will need to match something more complex than just a particular word or phrase in your output file.  Sometimes you will need to match a particular word, but only if it is found at the beginning of a line.  Or perhaps you will need to match a particular pattern of data, like a capital letter followed by a number, but you won't know the exact letter and number you are looking for.  These types of matching situations are handled with something called *regular expressions* which is accessed through the python module `re`.  While using regular expressions is outside the scope of this tutorial, they are very useful and you might want to learn more about them in the future.  A tutorial can be found at [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python book](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter7/). A great test site for regex is [here](https://regex101.com/)."
