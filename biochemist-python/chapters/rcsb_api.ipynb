    "Many databases can be accessed programmatically through something called a REST API. REST stands for Representational State Transfer. API stands for Application Programming Interface. A REST API is a type of web API that is used to allow different software systems to communicate with each other over the internet.\n",

    "\n",
    "Biopython has functions for retrieving structure files.\n",
    "To download a structure file from the PDB, you make a `PDBList`.\n",

    "You specify the folder where you want the file saved using `pdir=FOLDER`. \n",
    "If we want to download the structure as an MMCIF, we have to add `file_format=\"mmCif\"`.\n",

    "## PDB Data API\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the web to retrieve information about a molecule using its PDB ID using the PDB Data API. \n",
    "This will give you access to information about the PDB entry, rather than the structure file like with the Biopython file download.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, web APIs often work by varying text in a web address (also called URL).\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "https://data.rcsb.org/rest/v1/core/<TYPE_OF_RESOURCE>/<IDENTIFIER>\n",
    "```\n",

    "For example, to get the full entry for `4hhb`, you would do:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://data.rcsb.org/rest/v1/core/entry/4hhb\n",
    "\n",
    "Try clicking this link! It will display text in your browser with info about `4HHB`.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many things you can do with the REST API that are beyond this workshop. \n",
    "However, one interesting thing you can do is to retrieve PubMed annotations for an entry's primary citation.\n",

    "https://data.rcsb.org/rest/v1/core/pubmed/4hhb\n",

    "The data in these results is in a data format called JSON.  This is a commonly used type of return format for web APIs because it can be processed using programming. \n",
