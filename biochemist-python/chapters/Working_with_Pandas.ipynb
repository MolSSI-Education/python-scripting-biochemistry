    "## What is pandas and why do we use it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is a python library that is designed to work with two dimensional data arrays. It is built on numpy, another python library that specializes in numerical analysis. Numpy also has the ability to create and analyze data arrays. If you are not familiar with arrays, here are some simple examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1D arrays\n",
    "A one dimensional array is simply a list of items, for example, a list of the elements: H, He, Li, Be, B, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2D arrays\n",
    "A two dimensional array is an array which has rows and columns. It can have any number of columns and rows. A spreadsheet with rows and columns is analogous to a 2D array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3D arrays\n",
    "A three-dimensional array would be a collection of two dimensional arrays. For example, this might be a collection of x, y, and z coordinates for a structure as a function of time. \n",
    "\n",
    "The numpy library has functions that will manage n-dimensional arrays, while pandas only works on 2D arrays. You may need numpy for nD arrays at some point, but for this workshop, we will learn to use pandas as we learn how to perform linear and nonlinear regression of laboratory data based on data in 2D arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pandas library contains powerful tools for working with 2D data arrays, including the ability to identify the rows and columns of data by unique identifiers: things like \"Protein Concentration (mg/mL)\" and \"initial velocity\" rather than \"row 1\" or \"column C\"). Pandas also has many more functions that we will not explore in this workshop, but here are three excellent free online resources for learning more about pandas:\n",

    "\n",
    "As we move toward data analysis, we will need to import a series python **libraries**. A **library** is a set of modules which contain related functions that can be used to complete specific tasks. Using libraries in Python reduces the amount of code you have to write. Usually a function has some type of input and gives a particular output.  To use a function that is in a library, you often use the dot notation introduced previously.\n",

    "In the last lesson, we imported the `os` library, which can be used to assign the location of a file to a variable (e.g. datafile), so our script can be transferred between computers with different operating systems (e.g., Mac vs Windows). In this lesson, we will be using the `numpy` and `pandas`, and we will add a few more libraries in the future. As we proceed, we'll build this table. \n",

The [pandas dataframe](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) is the primary data structure that is produced and manipulated by pandas functions. We can take an existing 2D data array and tell pandas to convert it to a DataFrame, or we can use the read_csv command to convert a csv file to a pandas dataframe. As our example, we will be exploring a csv file containing information about different thrombin structures found in the [Protein Data Bank](https://www.rcsb.org/).
