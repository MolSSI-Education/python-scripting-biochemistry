    "## What is pandas and why do we use it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is a python library that is designed to work with two dimensional data arrays. It is built on numpy, another python library that specializes in numerical analysis. Numpy also has the ability to create and analyze data arrays. If you are not familiar with arrays, here are some simple examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1D arrays\n",
    "A one dimensional array is simply a list of items, for example, a list of the elements: H, He, Li, Be, B, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2D arrays\n",
    "A two dimensional array contains matched pairs of information. A list of elements with their atomic numbers would be a 2D array:  (H, 1), (He, 2), (Li, 3), (Be, 4), (B, 5), etc. It could also be a list of x, y data points that you want to plot: (1,1), (2,3), (3,5), (4,7). \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3D arrays\n",
    "A three dimensional array contains matched triads of information. One common 3D array in biochemistry and structural biology would be a collection of x, y, and z coordinates for the atoms in a protein, as are found in the [Protein Data Bank](http://www.rcsb.org/pdb). \n",
    "\n",
    "The numpy library has functions that will manage n-dimensional arrays, while pandas only works on 2D arrays. You may need numpy for nD arrays at some point, but for this workshop, we will learn to use pandas as we build toward the ability to perform linear and nonlinear regression of laboratory data based on data in 2D arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pandas library contains powerful tools for working with 2D data arrays, including the ability to identify the rows and columns of data by unique identifiers: things like \"mass protein\" and \"initial velocity\" rather than \"row 1\" or \"column C\"). Pandas also has many more functions that we will not explore in this workshop, but here are two excellent free online resources for learning more about pandas:\n",

    "## Importing python libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "As we move toward data analysis, we will need to import a series python **libraries**. A **library** is a set of modules which contain related functions that can be used to complete specific tasks. Using libraries in Python reduces the amount of code you have to write. Usually a function has some type of input and gives a particular output.  To use a function that is in a library, you often use the dot notation introduced in the previous lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last lesson, we imported the `os` library, which makes it easy to assign the location of a file to a single variable (e.g. datafile), rather than having to input the full path every time (e.g., Users/user_name/Desktop/python-scripting-biochemistry/biochemist-python/chapters/data). In this lesson, we will be using the `numpy` and `pandas`, and we will add a few more libraries in the future. As we proceed, we'll build this table. \n",

If you open a csv file in a text editor, it simply contains rows of information, where the information is separated by commas. The information can be integers, real numbers or strings. Here are the first four rows of the csv file that we will be exploring using pandas.\n",

The [pandas dataframe](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) is the primary data structure that is produced and manipulated by pandas functions. We can take an existing 2D data array and tell pandas to convert it to a DataFrame, or we can use the read_csv command to convert a csv file to a pandas dataframe.

As a biochemist, you probably want to plot and analyze these data to find the Km and Vmax. We'll get to that in a bit. The goal right now is to just have a little fun with pandas.\n",
