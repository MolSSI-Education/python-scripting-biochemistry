    "## Why Linear Regression?\n",
    "When I was a biochemistry grad student, we almost always manipulated our data into a linear format so that we could do linear regression on our handheld calculators. The most prominent example was the manipulation of enzyme kinetic data for Lineweaver-Burke or Eadie-Hofstee plots, so that we could determine the kinetic parameters (**Note**: we'll actually do non-linear curve fitting for enzyme kinetics in a future lesson).  I also remember doing semi-log plots of enzyme inactivation because they were linear. Now we have many more options by using python in Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, some data can still be analyzed by simple linear regression. Perhaps the most common case is the protein assay. Whether you use Lowry, Bradford or BCA methods, it is still most common to use a linear regression fit to the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, we will explore linear regression in Jupyter notebooks using Python. Please keep in mind - this is just a beginning. If you take a course in data science, you are likely to encounter a much deeper look at linear regression where you explore the relationships among many variables in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to build on the previous lesson, using the pandas library to import the data for this lesson. Then, we will perform the linear regression using the scipy library. "

We will use the dot notation we introduced earlier to access the functions in these libraries. I have expanded our table of libraries to help you keep track of your tools. Please note that the abbreviations listed are just the most common. You can actually define any abbreviation you like, but it is best to use the conventional abbreviations. This will help future coders (including yourself six months from now) as they work with the code. \n",

This is a very straightforward case, but if you look at the code, you can see that it could be applied to much more complex situations. When using pandas, people often append \\_df to the end of a variable name as a reminder that this is a dataframe, so the dataframe that contains our results might be called results_df. The code in the next cell will enable you to create the dataframe for this lesson. It should be mentioned that DataFrame is a reserved word when working with pandas dataframes, so you should not use that word as a variable name."
