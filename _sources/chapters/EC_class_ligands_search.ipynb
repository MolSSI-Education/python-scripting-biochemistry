    "Enzymes are biological catalysts and most enzymes are proteins (at least that's our current thinking). \n",
    "To systematize the study of enzymes, IUPAC (the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) has organized enzymes in a hierarchical class structure, with 7 top level classes and a total of 4 levels in the hierarchy. \n",
    "\n",
    "These classes are called the Enzyme Commission (EC) classes, and the hierarchy is called the EC system.\n",

    "The [BRENDA Enzyme Database](https://www.brenda-enzymes.org/) contains detailed information about enzymes and includes a [browser tree for enzyme classes](https://www.brenda-enzymes.org/ecexplorer.php?browser=1). The 7 major classes of enzymes on the top level of the tree are\n",
    "1. Oxidoreductases\n",

    "1. Lyases\n",
    "1. Isomerases\n",
    "1. Ligases\n",
    "1. Translocases\n",
    "\n",
    "On the [BRENDA Home Page](https://www.brenda-enzymes.org/index.php), you can search for an enzyme by name and find its Enzyme Commision (EC) number, and a lot more detail as well. \n",

    "In this notebook, we will focus on trypsin, an enzyme produced by your pancreas that helps to digest proteins in your small intestine. It is a member of family called serine hydrolases. Members of this family use water to break bonds in proteins, lipids and carbohydrates. They are involved in digestion, cell signalling and blood clotting. The EC# for trypsin is 3.4.21.4. Here is the meaning of each level of the hierarchy:\n",

    "\n",
    "This notebook is intended to help users find ligands for use with docking studies. \n",
    "We are looking for ligands that will bind to trypsin, with the intention of seeing if they will bind to other serine hydrolases that might be interesting. Here are the steps we will follow in the process, all of which will employ the `rcsbsearchapi` package. \n",
